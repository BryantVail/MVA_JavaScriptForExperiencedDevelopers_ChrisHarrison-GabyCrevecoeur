    'try' block executes code that is subject to break
        -MUST BE followed by either:
            1. exactly 1 'catch' block|| exactly 1 'funally' block
            2. Exception is passed to the 'catch' block
        'catch' block 
            -executes code that should only be ran when the exception is caught.
        'finally' block: 
            -optional
            -will always execute.
        -note:

        -declared as a function throughout the code
        -3 pieces of info:
            -error message
            -File where the error occurred
